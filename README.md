Simple Web with DOM
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project showcases a simple yet effective implementation of dynamic web elements using the Document Object Model (DOM). Whether you're new to JavaScript or looking for lightweight interactive features, this repository is a great starting point for DOM manipulation.
Features:
- Dynamic Content Updates â€“ Modify elements on the page without reloading.
- Event Listeners â€“ Interactive buttons, forms, and animations powered by JavaScript.
- DOM Traversal & Manipulation â€“ Easily find and modify HTML elements.
- Lightweight & Beginner-Friendly â€“ A simple and clean code structure for learning and experimentation.
Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this as a foundation for your own interactive web projects! ðŸš€
